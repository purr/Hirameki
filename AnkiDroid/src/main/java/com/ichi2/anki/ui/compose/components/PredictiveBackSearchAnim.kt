/**
 * open progress of a search bar (0f closed, 1f open), for [AnkiSearchBar]'s `searchAnim`.
 *
 * it also owns back while the search is open: the bar follows a predictive back gesture
 * (android 14+), springs back open when the gesture is cancelled, and [onClose] runs when back
 * commits. [AnkiSearchBar] is a TextField, so it has none of material3 SearchBar's built-in
 * predictive back.
 *
 * the newest registered back handler wins, so call this where the screen's search back handler
 * used to be declared; that keeps its priority against the screen's other handlers.
 *
 * @param backEnabled false while something drawn over the open search owns back (a navigation
 * drawer). registration order can't express that: a search in Scaffold's topBar is composed during
 * layout, so its handler registers after the drawer's and would win while both are enabled.
