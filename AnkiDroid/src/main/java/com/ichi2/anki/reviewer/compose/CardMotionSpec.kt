/**
 * Every number behind the reviewer card's gesture, in one place.
 *
 * The card is dragged toward a corner to grade it, and how it looks on the way in is a blend of two
 * behaviours chosen by how fast it was released: a slow, guided release makes it neck ([funnelNarrow]),
 * a fast throw makes it tumble ([tumbleDegrees]). Everything is a fraction of the card's own size or of
 * the trip to the corner, so the feel survives any screen size.
 *
 * Tune here rather than in [DraggableFlashcard]: nothing in the gesture hard-codes a magic number.
