/**
 * The reviewer's card as a card: tap to turn it over, then drag it into a corner to answer.
 *
 * It is shaped and sized like a bank card rather than filling the screen, so the four corner wells stay
 * visible around it. Both sides are real, separately rendered faces, so the flip only reveals a side
 * that is already painted, and nothing reflows when the answer appears.
 *
 * Geometry. The card always turns and shrinks about its own centre, and [cardOffset] is where that
 * centre is drawn. Corners, the registering point, the glow and the flight all read it, so a card
 * dropped in a corner lands its centre on the corner whichever part of it was held. Keeping the held
 * part under the thumb is then a question of where to put the centre: as the card shrinks the held
 * point would slide toward the middle, so each drag step solves for the centre that puts it back under
 * the finger ([THUMB_LOCK_TOLERANCE_PX]). An earlier version pivoted the card on the thumb instead; that
 * kept the thumb honest but threw every corner calculation off by where the card was held, so cards
 * landed up to half a card away from their corner.
 *
 * Nothing is recorded until the finger lifts. While dragging the card only shrinks as far as
 * [CardMotionSpec.dragFloorScale]; the rest of the journey happens on release, after which the card
 * stays hidden until the next card actually arrives, so the old one can never be graded twice.
 *
 * Motion lives entirely in [spec]; this function only applies it.
