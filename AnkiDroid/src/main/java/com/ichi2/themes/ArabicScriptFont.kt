/**
 * where vazirmatn replaces android's default arabic-script font (issue #139).
 *
 * android draws arabic, persian, urdu and kurdish with noto naskh arabic, a print face shipped in regular and bold
 * only, and none of the app's fonts (google sans flex, google sans rounded, roboto flex, the cards' roboto) has an
 * arabic glyph, so every arabic-script string fell through to it.
 *
 * ui: an arabic-script ui language switches the whole ui font to vazirmatn, whose latin is roboto's design. a
 * per-glyph fallback (google sans for latin, vazirmatn for arabic) cannot be written as an xml font-family or a
 * compose FontFamily, and roboto flex is a downloadable font the app never holds as a file to build a
 * Typeface.CustomFallbackBuilder chain from.
 *
 * cards: vazirmatn joins the hirameki card font stack after roboto, limited to arabic-script code points, in any
 * ui language.
